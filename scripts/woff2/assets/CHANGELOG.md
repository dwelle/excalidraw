# 1. Created "XiaolaiNotoEmoji" through FontForge

- Merged `XiaolaiSC-Regular.ttf` with `NotoEmoji-Regular.ttf` (kept in the codebase for future reference)
- Adjusted glyphs of the merged font to fit the Em box
- Added merged copyright & license
- Generated versions for different Em sizes 1000 and 2048 (otherwise `pyftmerge` isn't happy and throws)
